**Analyzing 10GB of Yelp Reviews Data**

For this project, we will analyze a subset of Yelp's business, reviews, and user data. The data is retrieved from Kaggle on https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset#yelp_academic_dataset_user.json. This data is loaded into our personal S3 bucket on AWS and used to convert into Spark DF for analysis. We are tasked with provisioning a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR for loading and running this analysis. The analysis is then created via Jupyter Notebook.
